# 📦 Supply Chain Price Prediction & Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes a large supply‑chain dataset (\~180,000 entries)
and builds predictive models to estimate product prices based on product
features, logistics, and availability. It includes exploratory data
analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and evaluation of multiple
machine‑learning algorithms.
